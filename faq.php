						<p id="howMuch">It is entirely up to you but I think you would want enough in it to make a profit after paying for our service. About $3000.00 per micro. One micro is approximately  $.10. We also suggest having a buffer so as to not stress out when the market moves against us. The buffer should be about $1000.00 per micro. An example of a buffer would be, if you plan on trading with $3000.00 and 1 micro you would want $1000.00 extra in the account as your buffer. </p>

						<p>We like FOREX.COM, specifically the <a href="https://www.forex.com/en-us/lp/mt4-metatrader?src=201706CAS158543&gclid=CNHz0d328dYCFVO4fgodWGQM6w&gclsrc=ds&dclid=CPSL3N328dYCFVd4YgodGk4MOA" target="_blank">MT4 platform</a>.  They do not pay us via endorsement or otherwise. Note: You can read the reviews of most brokers, which we encourage. As long as the broker you choose offers a reasonable delta between bid/ask prices (the spread) and if you live in the USA, you'll find a host of safe picks in the USA.  International traders can employ the same tests and, perhaps, regional brokers would be more suitable.</p>

					<label for="ac-3">Will I make money every day?</label>
					<article class="ac-large">
						<p>NO. The only way to make or lose money every day trading is to "day trade" (distict from trading daily). Market swings are less problematic with longer and broader projections than day trading would avail. We can go several 24 hour periods without any trades hitting our profit target but, in the same breath, we can have multiple trades hit our profit target within a single 24 hour period. The key to trading successfully is patience. You need to let the market run on its schedule; it's simply wasted energy to chase it. No matter how much you want the trade to move on your time frame the market has a mind of its own. If you can just relax and enjoy the ride it will pay off.</p>

					<label for="ac-4">How much money must I have in my account to trade your system?</label>
					<article class="ac-large">
						<p>You can always paper trade any amount that you wish.  Just set up a <a href="www.forex.com">demo account with MT4</a> (our preferred platform although most others will work just fine), set a starting amount and follow the simple money management guidelines below.</p>
						<p>If you wish to start with money you already have or will have in you account, you can deposit as little as $1000 and then gradually work your way up to higher increment(s).  Needless to say, the more you have the greater dollar amount return you will see.  We've established general minimum guidelines that we follow ourselves to prevent overtrading and adhere to crucial money management principles. Total risk per micro increment:</p>

					<label for="ac-5">Why not use a stop loss?</label>
					<article class="ac-large">
						<p>You can use a stop loss if you want but many good trades have been stopped out before they had a chance to become profitable. The Market is ALWAYS in charge. News releases or market drawdowns can stop out a good trade that was entered at the perfect spot the night before and you wake up the next day to find out the trade retraced and stopped out just to have it come back to the entry point a few hours later. This is more common than not. We protect our trades by using multiple entry points so that when the trade hits the profit target our better entries are profitable and the losses would be less. We try to make positive Pips on every trade but when not possible a break even or minimal loss is acceptable.</p>

					<input id="ac-6" name="accordion-1" type="checkbox" />
					<label for="ac-6">Can I exit a trade before the take profit?</label>
					<article class="ac-medium">
						<p>You can exit at any time you have profit but it will affect the total monthly Pips and the total amount of money you make each month. Remember we trade every trade we send to you so if you exit early your figures will differ from ours. If you want to make the money we make trust our system and stick to it. Once you see it work you will become a believer.</p>

					<input id="ac-8" name="accordion-1" type="checkbox" />
					<label for="ac-8">What is the SWAP?</label>
					<article class="ac-large">
						<p>The Swap is the interest paid or charged to you for the time you hold on to the Pair. Whether you get paid interest or are charged interest depends on the pair and the direction the pair is moving. An example would be if you Buy the AUD/USD you earn interest. If you Sell the AUD/USD you will be charged interest. Money is added or subtracted daily from your account according to this. This is important to understand because we may be holding trades for weeks. This is one of the reasons we try very hard to make a profit on every trade to compensate for interest  charges. The Spread is different. The Spread is the cost of entering every trade. It is the difference between the Buy and Sell. This is one of the reasons why upon entering a trade it is in the Red.

					<input id="ac-9" name="accordion-1" type="checkbox" />
					<label for="ac-9">Do I need to be an experienced trader to use your system? </label>
					<article class="ac-large">
						<p>No that is the beauty of this system. We give you everything you need, all you need to understand is how to place a trade on your trading platform. When you are ready to place a trade it will be a pending order not a market order. We use Stop orders not Limit orders about 95% of the time. So we will tell you to enter either a Buy or Sell  order as a pending order. We will tell you the price to set the Take Profit and all you do then is wait for The Market to move to bring us into the trade. Any adjustments made to the trades whether they are pending or live will come to you once a day between 7:00pm EST - 10:00am EST. The Market moves the most during the UK session between 4:00am EST - 10:00am EST so we want to make sure our trades are set before these times.

					<label for="ac-10">How long have you been trading?</label>
					<article class="ac-large">
						<p>We started trading in the mid-nineties with commodities and futures. Then switched to Forex about 2005. We first followed people who said they were professional traders only to find out they were just good salesmen so we had to develop our own trading system or continue to lose money and that just wasn't acceptable. We tried numerous systems but there was always a piece missing. We had to combine the right indicators to feel like it would meet all our criteria .WE feel really good about the system we created. It is not perfect but that system does not exist. There are other systems out there that probably work to generate a positive cash flow but the one we put together meets all our criteria.

					<label for="ac-11">If the market moves against you by a lot what do you do? </label>
					<article class="ac-medium">
						<p>The market cycles every 2-3 months in a way that can cause us to be in the red 500-1000 pips on any given pair. This usually happens on currencies that would be associated with the JPY or the GBP. However, it does not happen to all the pairs at the same time. The other pairs not affected continue to move in our direction. We will have multiple entries for the affected pairs and will patiently wait for a market correction and then move in our direction to our adjusted profit target. This is why it is important not to over trade re:<a href="faq.php" id="">How much should I start my account with?</a>. Make sure you do not let your margin get too low or you will be unable to correct course with a small loss, if necessary.

					<input id="ac-12" name="accordion-1" type="checkbox" />
					<label for="ac-12">What do I do if my account gets too far in the red and my margin gets too low? </label>
					<article class="ac-large">
						<p>This is usually caused by over trading. The solution has many parts. The obvious one would be to fund your account with more money and continue holding on to all of your trades. If this is not possible then consider exiting profitable trades completely or partially by closing only half of the micros. An example would be if you are trading 2 micros then only close 1. Any new trades you enter cut back on the size. If all trades that are profitable have been taken care of then you need to start closing out the negative trades. This can be done in the same manner as you did with the profitable ones. A good rule of thumb is to always keep a close eye on the number of entries your account can handle. DO NOT exceed 1 micro for every $3000.00. This rule usually keeps you out of this problem. If you want to be sure you will never have this problem then we suggest to have a buffer in your account. This means you trade with a certain amount and have extra in the account you don't trade with. An example would be if your account has $3000.00 in it only trade as if it has $2000.00. A buffer of $1000.00 for every micro you trade will keep you from being concerned about margin.

					<input id="ac-13" name="accordion-1" type="checkbox" />
					<label for="ac-13">Why is my pip total and profit percentage different than yours?</label>
					<article class="ac-large">
						<p>There are a number of reasons for this. Depending on when you joined you may not have the advantage of Carry Over. Carry Over is trades that where entered in the previous month and hit the take profit in the next month are only calculated for the month the take profit is hit. An example would be if you join on the 15TH of the month you would have missed 15 days of the month you joined. Give it 2-3 months to allow your account to get in sink with ours. Another reason things might differ is depending on your broker and there fill price. We try to take this into account and only calculate averages for each month.
